        <h2 id="Project_Overview">Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
          This section aims to give a general overview of the project, its
          goals, and its components.
        </p>

        <h3 id="Introduction_and_Goals">Introduction and Goals</h3>
        <p>
          The main goal of this project is to facilitate collaboration between
          M.D.s in order for them to be able to create research-based actionable
          findings linking different foods and health conditions. Their results
          will be used to inform Actual Food's online ordering platform.
        </p>

        <h3 id="Actionable_Findings">Actionable Findings</h3>
        <p>
          Actionable Findings are research-based findings that link certain
          foods to certain health conditions, and may or may not include
          additional information about this link. An example would be
          "Blueberries increase natural killer cell counts, reducing arterial
          stiffness." (this is a random example, please don't quote me on this).
          Here, the food involved is blueberries, the condition involved is
          arterial stiffness, and the link is that of a reduction in symptoms.
          Additionally, the mechanism is through an increase of natural killer
          cell counts. This Actionable Finding could also include additional
          information such as what populations are most affected by this
          finding, in what doses does this apply, and more. The complete list of
          Actionable Finding fields is still not final, but the project
          wireframes provide an idea of what they could look like.
        </p>

        <h3 id="Debunked_Myths">Debunked Myths</h3>
        <p>
          Debunked Myths, like Actionable Findings, also link certain foods to
          certain health conditions, and also may or may not include additional
          information about this link. In terms of the app's implementation,
          Debunked Myths share the same functionality and behavior as Actionable
          Findings, differing only in what fields they may contain. The biggest
          difference, is that Debunked Myths are meant to specifically address
          links between certain foods and health conditions that exist in pop
          culture or the world of nutrition as popular myths. Debunked Myths, as
          the name suggests, aim to debunk these popular myths through research.
        </p>

        <h3 id="Nutritional_Composition">Nutritional Composition</h3>
        <p>
          The Nutritional Composition section of the app, provides information
          about the nutritional contents of many food items. A lot of this data
          will be pulled from a public database, but the application also allows
          users to add their own nutritional composition findings.
        </p>

        <h3 id="Work_Pile">Work Pile</h3>
        <p>
          The Work Pile provides a user-friendly UX for the creation of
          Actionable Findings, Debunked Myths, and Nutritional Composition
          items. It allows users to see a shared pile of research papers that
          need to be reviewed. While reviewing these papers, users have the
          option of highlighting specific parts of the papers in order to create
          Actionable Findings, Debunked Myths, or Nutritional Composition items.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here, users can also add new research papers to the Work Pile for
          review.
        </p>

      <div>
        <h2 id="App_Architecture">App Architecture</h2>
        <p>
          This section will explore the overall architecture of the app.
          Including the main patterns being used as well as the custom
          implementation parts of the app.
        </p>

        <h3 id="Astronomy_Classes">Astronomy Classes</h3>
        <p>
          The app's data is stored in a Mongo database, as plain objects. Meteor
          encourages developers to write Meteor methods to interact with these
          objects. However, in more complex cases, it is useful to have
          something more capable than a simple plain object that can be
          interacted with through external methods. For our use case, it is also
          useful for an object to be able to have its own methods that act on
          itself, as well as lifecycle hooks, and pre-defined schema for
          validation.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://jagi.github.io/meteor-astronomy/">Astronomy</a> is a
          Meteor package that introduces the model layer to Meteor, and it
          allows objects to behave like class instances that can have their own
          pre-defined schema, behaviors, events, and methods.
        </p>

        <h3 id="Main_Objects,_Field_Containers,_and_Field_Objects">
          Main Objects, Field Containers, and Field Objects
        </h3>
        <p>
          The app's architecture for Actionable Findings, Debunked Myths,
          Sources, Health Conditions, Dietary Items, and all their respective
          fields is based around Main Objects and Field Objects, which are
          linked by Field Containers. These are all Astronomy models. This
          architecture was created to allow for a edit-history system, where
          each Main Object can have multiple different versions for each of
          their editable fields.
        </p>
        <h4>Main Objects</h4>
        <p>
          Main Objects represent objects that have fields whose versions can be
          changed. In this case, our app's Main Objects are Actionable Findings,
          Debunked Myths, Sources, Health Conditions, and Dietary Items.
        </p>
        <p>
          All Main Objects inherit from a parent Main Object Class, called
          <code>mainObjectModel</code>, inside
          <code>"/imports/api/mainObjects"</code>. This parent model defines
          common properties, behaviors, and methods for all mainObjects.
        </p>
        <p>
          The specific class definitions for Actionable Findings, Debunked
          Myths, and other Main Objects can be found in the files
          <code>"/imports/api/mainObjects/actionableFindingModel"</code>,
          <code>"/imports/api/mainObjects/debunkedMythModel"</code>, and so on.
          These child classes define what specific editable fields each model
          has, as well as which of them are mandatory. You can access a Main
          Object's type with <code>mainObject.type</code>. All Main Objects,
          regardless of type are stored in the same
          <code>"mainObjects"</code> collection, which is made available to the
          client through a publication of the same name.
        </p>

        <h4>Field Objects</h4>
        <p>
          Field Objects represent editable fields on Main Objects, such as, for
          example, a description on an Actionable Finding. The parent class for
          all Field Object models is defined in
          <code>"/imports/api/mainObjects/fields/fieldObjectModel"</code>. This
          class defines the common top-level structure of all Field Objects,
          which includes a Version object property and some methods to sync
          author usernames. The Version object stores information about the
          version number of a given Field Object, as well as authorship
          information, an optional version note, and whether that version is a
          reversion to a previous version (as well as what that previous version
          is and who authored it). All Field Objects are stored in the
          <code>"fieldObjects"</code> collection.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each different Field Object has its own model that inherits from the
          parent Field Object model. The specific child model for a Field Object
          contains a <code>body</code> field, which is where the specific schema
          of each field is defined. The body differs for each different field,
          however, they must all have a <code>nA</code> property of the type
          Boolean, that allows the Field Object to be marked as N/A. The default
          value of the <code>nA</code> property should be <code>false</code>.
        </p>

        <h4>Field Containers</h4>
        <p>
          Field Containers act as a joiner model for Main Objects and Field
          Objects. A Main Object has one Field Container per editable field.
          Different versions of that field are represented as different Field
          Objects that belong to a common Field Container. The model for all
          Field Containers can be seen in
          <code>"/imports/api/mainObjects/fields/fieldContainerModel"</code>.
          Besides joining Main Objects and Field Objects, Field Containers also
          store the current version of a field.
        </p>

        <h4>Versioning</h4>
        <p>
          The version of an editable Main Object field can be altered through
          updates or reversions. Regardless of the operation, an edit to a field
          will always create a new Field Object and increment the current
          version number on the respective Field Container.
        </p>

        <p>
          For example, If I create an Actionable Finding with a description,
          that description will be considered as version 1 of the description
          field. If I update it later, it will create a new Field Object with
          the new description body and a Version object with a version number of
          2. This will also update the current version number on the respective
          Field Container to 2. This system is set up in a way that these
          changes will be automatically and immediately reflected on the Main
          Object, or in this case, the Actionable Finding.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now, if I revert that same description back to version 1, it will
          create a new Field Object with the same description body as version 1,
          but with a different Version object with a property that marks it as a
          reversion (<code>isReversion</code>) and a property that stores what
          version this reversion refers to (<code>reversionNumber</code>). This
          new Field Object will have the version number of 3, and the respective
          Field Container will have its current version property updated to 3.
          Again, this will be automatically and immediately reflected on the
          Actionable Finding.
        </p>

        <p>
          In summary, any edit to a field will always lead to a version number
          increment, even reversions.
        </p>

        <p>
          It's also worth noting that, if you try to revert to a reversion, the
          current system will revert to the original version instead.
        </p>

        <h4>Modularity and Dicts</h4>
        <p>
          The app's frontend has been set up in a way such that all logic and
          pages pertaining to Main Objects are only defined once for all types
          of Main Objects, and the same is true for all Field Objects. As such,
          there are multiple dictionaries (objects of simple key-value pairs)
          throughout different files in the app that facilitate this
          modularization, by linking different types of objects to their
          respective values in different situations. A lot of these dictionaries
          that are commonly accessed throughout the app, are found in the file
          <code>"/imports/common/dicts"</code>, but those that are only used
          once or that deal with file imports, are found in their respective
          relevant files.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >Note: I have looked into dynamic imports to simplify and
            standardize the current setup with multiple import dicts in multiple
            files. Unfortunately, due to the
            <a href="https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/issues/6702"
              >limitations of Svelte's bundler</a
            >, it is not possible to dynamically import variable modules
            reliably, so we have to keep these multiple import dicts in their
            respective files for the best stability.
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>
            In developing the app, whenever a new new Main Object or Field
            Object type is created, it is crucial to go through all these
            dictionaries (not only in <code>"/imports/common/dicts</code>) and
            add key-value pairs for the new type. Therefore, when adding Main
            Object or Field Object types, carefully check all files throughout
            the app to make sure the dictionaries are up to date!
          </b>
        </p>
        <p>
          The purpose of the dictionaries inside
          <code>"/imports/common/dicts"</code> is to facilitate modularization
          and standardize associations. The
          <code>mainObjectFieldsDict</code> and the
          <code>mainObjectsMandatoryFieldsDict</code> define what editable
          fields each different type of Main Object can have, and which of these
          are mandatory, respectively. The difference is that non-mandatory
          fields can be marked as N/A, while mandatory fields cannot. If you
          make changes to these dictionaries directly, they will only be
          reflected on new Main Objects, unless you reset the database.
        </p>
        <p>
          The
          <code>mainObjectNameDict</code> provides an easy way to convert
          between a code-friendly Main Object type name, such as
          <code>"actionableFindings"</code> to the human-presentable form
          <code>"Actionable Finding"</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <code>fieldNameDict</code> does the same thing but for Field
          Objects.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <code>newFieldDict</code> provides template body objects for
          creating new fields. These appear in the app when creating a new Main
          Object and are meant to be completely empty. These must be filled out
          by the user before submitting a new Main Object, as their empty
          subfields will lead to validation errors.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <code>nAFieldDict</code> provides a template for the body of a
          field initialized as N/A. The purpose is to have a body that is stored
          for an N/A field that is essentially empty but won't lead to any
          validation errors.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <code>testFieldDict</code>, <code>testFieldDict2</code>, and
          <code>testFieldDict3</code> dictionaries provide sample filled-out
          field bodies to be used in tests.
        </p>
        <p>
          All dictionaries in this file are frozen (read-only) using
          <code>Object.freeze()</code>, which prevents these dictionaries from
          being edited from the outside. This is done because these dictionaries
          essentially act as global variables, and it would be dangerous to not
          enforce a read-only structure as editing these dictionaries in other
          files could lead to all sorts of unexpected and hard to debug
          behavior.
        </p>
        <p>
          In JS, trying to edit a frozen Object won't throw any errors, but it
          won't work either. If you're trying to edit these dictionaries in
          another file, make a copy of them instead using
          <code>{...dictionaryName}</code> for a shallow copy or
          <code>_.cloneDeep(dictionaryName)</code> for a deep copy (requires the
          <a href="https://lodash.com/">lodash</a> package).
        </p>

        <h4>Adding a Field Object</h4>
        <p>
          The modular architecture was implemented to make the process of adding
          new Field Objects simpler for developers. If followed correctly, any
          new Field Object will automatically show up in the Create and Show
          pages for the Main Objects they're found in, all the editing and
          reversion logic will work on them as expected, and a suite of tests
          will be automatically generated for the new field to check that all
          user operations work as expected with it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Here's how you can easily create a new Field Object for this
          application:
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Backend process:</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b
            >Note: There are many important details in steps 1-5 that must be
            followed exactly in order for the new Field Object to work correctly
            with the rest of the application. Therefore, it is strongly
            recommended that you create your new field by copying the model file
            of an existing Field Object and modify it to your needs by changing
            the names and the <code>body</code> class. Still, read through these
            steps to make sure your new Field Object model file is formatted
            correctly.
          </b>
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Start by creating a model file for your new field, which will
              contain the Astronomy class definition for this new field. Create
              your file in the
              <code>"/imports/api/mainObjects/fields"</code> directory and
              follow the naming convention of <code>"fieldNameModel.js"</code>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Inside this file, import <code>{ Class }</code> from
              <code>"meteor/jagi:astronomy"</code>,
              <code> { FieldObjects } </code> from
              <code>"/imports/db/collections"</code>, and
              <code>{ FieldObject }</code>from
              <code>"./fieldObjectModel"</code>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Still inside the same file, create a class (in the form of an
              exported const) that inherits from <code>Field Object</code>. This
              class should have a <code>name</code> property that contains a
              camelCased and singular name for the new field, a
              <code>collection</code> property that has the value of
              <code> FieldObjects </code>, and a <code>fields</code> property
              that should be an object with a property of <code>body</code>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The value for the <code>body</code> property should be another
              Astronomy class defined in the same file, with a
              <code>name</code> property with the value of a string in the
              format of "fieldNameBody", and a <code>fields</code> property that
              should be an object that defines the specific schema of this new

                Make sure that the first property you define inside
                <code>body</code> is a field called <code>nA</code>, of the type
                <code>Boolean</code>, and that has a default value of a function
                that returns <code>false</code>.</b

              If you'd like to add any custom lifecycle behavior to your field
              object, including extra verification behaviors that go beyond what
              the schema allows, add some Astronomy events on the Field Object
              class or the Field Object Body Class. Here is a
              <a href="https://jagi.github.io/meteor-astronomy/#events-list"
                >list of lifecycle events for Astronomy models</a
              >. For anything to do with extra verification or
              changing/generating values on creating and updating objects, I
              recommend the <code>beforeSave</code> event.

          <li>
            Once the model file for your new Field Object is created, go into
            <code>"/imports/common/dicts"</code>, and add the name of your new
            field inside <code>mainObjectFieldsDict</code> and
            <code>mainObjectMandatoryFieldsDict</code>, associating your new
            field to your desired Main Object(s).
            <b
              >Note that mandatory fields must be included in both
              dictionaries!</b
            >
            <b>
              Also note that the name you use for your new field in these
              dictionaries should be the same as the <code>name</code> property
              you defined in the field's class (camelCased and singular).
            </b>
          </li>
          <li>
            Proceed to fill out all field dicts with the correct information for
            your new field. Ensure that you follow the schema you defined in
            your model file.
          </li>
          <li>
            Go into <code>"imports/api/mainObjects"</code> and find the model
            files for the Main Objects that you want to include your new field.
            In these files, add your new field as a Main Object field (inside
            the <code>fields</code> property) in the following format:
            <pre class="code-block">
<code>
newFieldName: { 
  type: FieldObject, 
  optional: true, 
}
</code>
            </pre>
            <b
              >It's important to set <code>optional</code> to <code>true</code>,
              even if your field is mandatory in a given Main Object. This is
              due to how the initialization logic for new Main Objects is
              handled. The enforcement of mandatory/non-mandatory is done
              instead through the client-available Meteor Methods for Main
              Objects.</b
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            Go into <code>"/imports/api/mainObjects/mainObjectModel"</code> and
            import your new Field Object model file there. Add a key-value pair
            inside <code>fieldTypeDict</code> at the top of the file, with the
            key being your new field's camelCased singular name, and the value
            being your field's import.
          </li>
          <li>
            Do the same thing you just did but inside
            <code>"/tests/mainObjectHelpersTests"</code>, that is, importing
            your new field's model file and adding a key-value pair of the
            field's name and import in the <code>fieldTypeDict</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              At this stage, your new field should be ready for testing. Run the
              test suite using the command <code>npm run test-app</code> inside
              the <code>app</code> directory. If all tests passed successfully,
              then congratulations! Your new field has been correctly added to
              the application's backend.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, if tests are failing, carefully read the test failure
              messages and try to figure out what went wrong. Re-read steps 1-9
              to make sure you followed the process correctly.
            </p>
            <b
              >Note: Occasionally, it is possible that you will run into a
              <code>timeOut</code> error when running tests. This does not
              indicate a code failure, but rather, that the process of running a
              test exceeded Mocha's (testing package) timeout limit. You can fix
              this by increasing the <code>MOCHA_TIMEOUT</code> environment
              variable in <code>package.json</code>.

          <i>Frontend process:</i>
        </p>
        <b
          >Note: Only go through the frontend process to add a new field once
          you've successfully finished adding it on the backend!</b
        >
        <p>
          The process of adding your new field to the application's frontend
          consists in creating a couple of render files and going through
          another couple of files to make sure the new field is imported and
          added to dictionaries where necessary.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Go to <code>"/imports/ui/mainObjects/fields"</code>. Inside this
            directory, create a new folder with your new field's name.
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Inside your new directory, make a <code>Create</code> file and a
              <code>Show</code> file for your new field. The
              <code>Create</code> file determines how your field will be
              displayed when creating a new Main Object with this field, or
              editing this field on an existing Main Object. The
              <code>Show</code> file determines how your field will be displayed
              in every other regular situation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Go ahead and fill out these files following the existing structure
              in other field <code>Create</code> and <code>Show</code> files.
              You should only have to modify the parts where your field's
              properties are displayed.
              <b
                >Therefore, it is strongly recommended that you copy these two
                files from another existing field and modify the rendering to
                fit your new field's specific properties.</b
              >
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Go into the file <code>"/imports/ui/mainObjects/fields/Field"</code>
            and import your new field's show and create pages. Add your new
            field's name, alongside the correct imports inside
            <code>fieldShowDict</code> and <code>fieldCreateDict</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Finally, go into the file
            <code>"/imports/ui/mainObjects/Create"</code>, and import your new
            field's create page. Add your new field's name alongside its create
            page import inside the <code>fieldCreateDict</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              At the moment, there are no formal tests for the app's frontend
              UI, so go ahead and test your new field's UI manually by trying to
              create a new Main Object with your new field, editing it,
              reverting it, and marking it as N/A.
            </p>
            <p>
              If everything is working as expected, then congratulations, you
              finished adding your new field to the application!

        <h3 id="Main_Object_API">Main Object API - an MVC approach</h3>
        <p>
          All the logic to interact with Main Objects and their respective Field
          Objects has been implemented using an
          <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller"
            >MVC pattern</a
          >. An MVC pattern stands for "Model, View, Controller".
        </p>
        <p>
          A "Model" is where an object's logic resides, including its own
          private methods, behaviors, and lifecycle hooks. In this case, the
          files inside
          <code>"/imports/api/mainObjects"</code> and
          <code>"/imports/api/mainObjects/fields"</code> define the models for
          Main Objects and Field Objects (as well as Field Containers) in our
          application. More specifically, the file
          <code>"/imports/api/mainObjects/mainObjectModel"</code> contains the
          vast majority of the logic pertaining to Main Objects and their
          interactions with Field Objects and Field Containers. This logic can
          be seen specifically in the helper methods defined inside the Main
          Object model, as these methods deal with operations including creating
          new Field Objects, editing fields, reverting fields, and syncing these
          with their parent Main Object.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, these helper methods are only accessible from the server. In
          order for the client to interact with these models, they must go
          through a "controller" API that defines certain methods that can be
          called from the client to act on Main Object Models and their
          associated fields. The purpose of this extra communication step is
          mainly to ensure that a user on the client is authorized to perform
          operations on Main Object Models, but also to abstract the model logic
          into a simpler and client-friendly API.
        </p>

        <p>
          This client-accessible API can be found inside the file
          <code>"/imports/api/mainObjectMethods"</code>, which defines multiple
          Meteor Methods for the client to interact with Main Objects and their
          fields in the server. This file includes a description of each method,
          as well as what arguments they take, and what they return.
        </p>

        <p>
          The "views" component of this pattern can be seen inside the
          <code>"/imports/ui/mainObjects"</code> folder, where rendering files
          are defined to display the Main Object models and their fields to the
          client.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2 id="Error_Throwing">Error Throwing</h2>
        <p>
          This section still needs to be written after some further code
          refactoring.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2 id="Testing">Testing</h2>
        <p>
          There is a suite of tests already available for this application
          inside the <code>"tests"</code> directory which, at the moment, test
          the functionality of all non-UI code pertaining to the Main Object MVC
          structure. This includes testing every single helper method defined in
          the <code>"/imports/api/mainObjects/mainObjectModel"</code> file as
          well as all client-available Meteor methods defined in the
          <code>"/imports/api/mainObjects/mainObjectMethods"</code> file.
        </p>

        <p>
          Currently, the tests mentioned above test the base-case usage of these
          methods, but they also test as many edge-cases of the client-available
          Meteor methods as I could think of.
        </p>

        <p>
          As more parts of the application are built, more tests will be added.
          If you build a new portion of the app, make sure to also include some
          tests that ensure its functionality. The more thorough these tests and
          the more situations they account for, the better.
        </p>

        <p>
          In order to run all existing server tests once, type the command
          <code>npm run test</code>. In order to have all server and client
          tests running during development, in a continuos integration testing
          fashion, type the command <code>npm run test-app</code>. You wil then
          be able to access the app on your browser in testing mode by going to
          port 5100.
